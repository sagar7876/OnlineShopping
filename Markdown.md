Welcome ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for your interest in contributing to MDN Web Docs. We are happy to have you join us! ðŸ’–

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on project areas we might have forgotten about or assumed to work well.
These include, but are not limited to:

- Problems found while setting up a new developer environment
- Gaps in our documentation
- Bugs in our automation scripts

If anything doesn't make sense or work as expected, please open an issue and let us know!

## Ways to contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

- Identifying and filing issues.
- Providing feedback on existing issues.
- Engaging with the community and answering questions.
- Contributing documentation or code.
- Promoting the project in personal circles and social media.

## Finding an issue

We have issues labeled `good first issue` for new contributors and `help wanted` suitable for any contributor.
Good first issues have extra information to help you make your first contribution a success.
Help wanted issues are ideal when you feel a bit more comfortable with the project details.

Sometimes there won't be any issues with these labels, but there is likely still something for you to work on.
If you want to contribute but don't know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, speak to us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#mdn:mozilla.org), and we will be happy to help.

Once you find an issue you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying you want to work on it.
Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.
Also, mention the community team using the `@mdn/mdn-community-engagement` handle to ensure someone will get back to you.

## Asking for help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to use the following channels in the following order of precedence:

- [Start a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions)
- Ask your question or highlight your discussion on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#mdn:mozilla.org).
- File an issue and tag the community team using the `@mdn/mdn-community-engagement` handle.

## Pull request process
